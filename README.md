## üéØ Overview

ORBIT is a modular, self-hosted toolkit that provides a unified API for open-source AI inference models. It enables you to run AI models on your own infrastructure, maintaining complete control over your data while eliminating commercial API dependencies.

## Sovereignty and Data Control

ORBIT is designed with digital sovereignty in mind, offering several key advantages:

1. **Complete Data Control**: All data processing happens on your infrastructure, ensuring sensitive information never leaves your environment
2. **No External Dependencies**: By eliminating reliance on commercial AI APIs, you maintain full control over your AI capabilities
3. **Compliance Ready**: Self-hosted deployment makes it easier to comply with data residency requirements and privacy regulations
4. **Transparency**: Open-source nature allows full visibility into the system's operations and data handling
5. **Customization**: Ability to modify and adapt the system to meet specific organizational or national requirements

This makes ORBIT particularly valuable for:

- Government agencies requiring sovereign AI capabilities
- Organizations with strict data privacy requirements
- Countries implementing digital sovereignty initiatives
- Enterprises needing to maintain control over their AI infrastructure

## üöÄ Quick Start

### System Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- MongoDB for API key management
- Ollama for inference (other services supported, see config.yaml)
- ChromaDB or SQLite (other engines supported)
- Optional: GPU for accelerated inference
- Optional: Elasticsearch for logging

### 1. Install and configure MongoDB
Follow MongoDB installation guide: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

Update MongoDB configuration in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
internal_services:
  mongodb:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 27017
    database: "orbit"
    apikey_collection: "api_keys"
    username: ${INTERNAL_SERVICES_MONGODB_USERNAME}
    password: ${INTERNAL_SERVICES_MONGODB_PASSWORD}
```

### 2. Server Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/schmitech/orbit.git
cd orbit

# Install dependencies
./bin/setup.sh

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Ollama
https://ollama.com/download

```bash
# Download the models
ollama pull gemma3:1b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### 4. Configuration
Copy and configure the main config file:
```bash
# The config.yaml file is located in the project root
# Edit config.yaml to adjust settings for your environment
```

### 5. Launch Server
```bash
# Start the server
./bin/start.sh

# Or use the control script
./bin/orbit.sh start
```

### 6. Server Management
```bash
# Check server status
./bin/orbit.sh status

# Stop the server
./bin/orbit.sh stop

# Restart the server
./bin/orbit.sh restart
```

### 7. API Key Management
```bash
# Create an API key for a collection
./bin/orbit.sh key create --collection docs --name "My Client"

# List API keys
./bin/orbit.sh key list

# Test an API key
./bin/orbit.sh key test --key your-api-key
```

### 8. Sample Database Setup
```bash
# For SQLite database
./install/setup-demo-db.sh sqlite

# For Chroma database (requires Ollama running with nomic-embed-text model)
./install/setup-demo-db.sh chroma
```

The script will:
- Set up the database (SQLite or Chroma)
- Create necessary collections
- Generate API keys for the collections
- Provide instructions for testing the setup

Server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 9. Client Setup

#### Python Client

```bash
pip install schmitech-orbit-client

# The chat client implementation can be found in /clients/python/schmitech_orbit_client/chat_client.py
orbit-chat --url http://localhost:3000
```

### Configuration

The system is configurable through a YAML configuration file, allowing you to:

- Select and configure inference providers
- Choose embedding and vector database backends
- Set up safety and reranking services
- Configure logging and monitoring
- Manage API authentication
- Set up HTTPS/SSL
- Configure system resources and threading

  config:
    # Adapter-specific configuration options
    confidence_threshold: 0.5
    max_results: 5
    return_results: 3
    # Other adapter-specific settings
```
