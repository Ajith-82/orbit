# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other members of the community.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing courtesy and respect to everyone.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
