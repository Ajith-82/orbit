# ORBIT Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the strategic direction and planned enhancements for ORBIT (Open Retrieval-Based Inference Toolkit). Our goal is to transform ORBIT into a comprehensive enterprise-grade AI platform while maintaining its core principles of data sovereignty and open-source accessibility.

## Feature Roadmaps

### 1. [Prompt Service Enhancement](prompt-service.md)
Transforming prompt management into a comprehensive orchestration platform:
- LangChain integration
- RAG context management
- Template versioning
- Example-based management

### 2. [Workflow Adapter System](workflow-adapter-architecture.md)
Building a flexible workflow orchestration system:
- API integration
- Webhook support
- Event-driven architecture
- Workflow versioning

### 3. [Concurrency & Performance Optimization](concurrency-performance.md)
Scaling ORBIT to handle thousands of concurrent requests:
- Enhanced thread pool management
- Multi-worker uvicorn configuration
- Intelligent load balancing
- Auto-scaling and circuit breaker patterns
- Real-time performance monitoring

### 4. [LLM Guard Security Integration](llm-guard-integration.md) âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
Enterprise-grade AI security and threat protection:
- Dedicated FastAPI security microservice
- Advanced prompt injection and jailbreak detection
- Comprehensive content sanitization
- Real-time threat intelligence
- Compliance-ready audit trails

**Implementation Status**: The LLM Guard service has been fully integrated into Orbit. See the [LLM Guard Service Documentation](../llm-guard-service.md) for configuration and usage details.

### 5. [Asynchronous Messaging & Multi-Modal Processing](async-messaging-integration.md)
Scalable async processing with message queue protocols:
- Multi-platform message queue support (RabbitMQ, Kafka, Pub/Sub)

- Real-time job progress tracking via WebSocket/SSE
- Event-driven workflow orchestration
- Dynamic worker scaling and resource optimization

### 6. [Notification Service Integration](notification-service-integration.md)
Comprehensive multi-channel communication system:
- Email, webhook, SMS, push notification support
- Team collaboration integration (Slack, Teams, Discord)
- Event-driven notifications for jobs, security, workflows
- User preference management and quiet hours
- Enterprise compliance and audit trails

### 7. [Security & Access Control](security-access.md)
Implementing enterprise-grade security:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- OAuth2.0 and SSO integration
- API key management
- Audit logging and compliance

### 8. [Enterprise Features](enterprise-features.md)
Adding enterprise capabilities:
- Analytics and monitoring
