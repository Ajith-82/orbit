# Multilingual Chat Support

This document explains the multilingual chat support functionality that automatically detects the language of a user's query and instructs the LLM to respond in the same language.

## Overview

The chat service includes language detection capability that:

1. Detects the language of the user's input query
2. Modifies the system prompt to include instructions for the LLM to respond in the same language
3. Creates a temporary system prompt with these language instructions
4. Uses this enhanced prompt for generating the response

This functionality is automatically enabled for all chat interactions and requires no configuration changes.

## How It Works

The language detection process follows these steps:

1. When a user sends a message, the `ChatService` detects the language using the `LanguageDetector` utility.
2. If the language is not English, the system prompt is enhanced with instructions to respond in the detected language.
3. A temporary system prompt is created with these language-specific instructions.
4. The LLM uses this enhanced prompt to generate a response in the appropriate language.

## Supported Languages

The language detector can identify many languages, with particularly good support for:

- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Russian (ru)
- Chinese (zh)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)
- Arabic (ar)
- Hindi (hi)

## Implementation Details

The language detection is implemented in:

- `server/services/chat_service.py`: Contains the core logic for detecting language and enhancing prompts
- `utils/language_detector.py`: Provides robust language detection capability

### Key Methods

- `ChatService._detect_and_enhance_prompt()`: Detects the language and enhances the system prompt
- `LanguageDetector.detect()`: Identifies the language of a given text

## Demo and Testing

A demonstration example is provided in `server/test/language_detection_demo.py`. This script shows how the language detection works with different language inputs.

Tests for the language detection functionality are available in `server/tests/test_language_detector.py`.
